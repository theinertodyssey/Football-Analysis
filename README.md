# Football-Analysis
I tried to build a very basic football analysis platform. 

Even you can also upload your data and get it analysed, though I've given a default data for the analysis. 
(English Premier League -> 1993-2024)

Data Source Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/english-premier-league-standings

Just make sure that the data which you are giving, has the columns similar to the below image.

And boom!
You're good to go...

How I built it:- 
Explored the internet ->   Got a rough idea ->   Looked for tutorials & documentations ->   Got multiple errors ->   Took help from Youtube & AI ->   & that's it!
